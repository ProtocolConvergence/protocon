 CS5811 Not Project Proposal:\\
 Search for Self-Stabilizing Protocols
}

\maketitle



Comments on your proposal document:

{\it Is a protocol defined in a standard way? Show the protocol explicitly in the example you provided.}

YES

{\it Formulate the search problem: states, actions, goals.
\begin{itemize}
\item Show how BDDs represent states.
\item Show the input file format
\end{itemize}
}

{\it A SAT solver is a special case of a CSP solver. How will your methods be different from the SAT solver?}

It blows up in size when given to a SAT solver.

{\it How can the manual step in 1 be automated?}

TODO

{\it Aim to have a working system for a very simple example even if heuristics do not perform well.}

Sounds reasonable (no answer)

{\it For experiments: create (or identify from literature) a set of benchmark problems of varying complexity}

\begin{itemize}
\item Dijkstra's token ring
\item Maximal matching
\item 3-coloring
\end{itemize}

{\it Provide time estimates and tasks. Identify tasks for project group members.}
